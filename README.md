## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I have gained some valuable layout CSS coding experience, making design responsive while paying attention to every single detail to make it look as close to the design as possible.
- My JavaScript knowledge and experience have slightly improved, by using boolean values to determine if a certain element is beign shown or hidden on the page, and depending on that, certain logic is being executed, and states changed. 
- I have gained valuable confidence to keep me pushing towards my goals. I want to keep building on that.


### Continued development
- I plan on becoming skillful in React.js
- I would like to know more about Backend stuff, probably learn some Backend language later on

### Useful resources
- No specific resources used for this project, but I can always refer to Kevin Powell and his website and YouTube Channel to hone your CSS skills. 
- Speaking of JavaScript, I can always recommend you Maximillian Schwarzmuller and many of his courses. In my opinion, those are one of the best well-structured courses around, and 
Max is a top quality teacher
